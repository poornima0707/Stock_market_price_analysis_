## **Practical Application**

Stock price prediction serves multiple stakeholders, including:

- **Investors**: Make informed decisions and identify profitable opportunities.
- **Traders**: Adapt their strategies based on predicted price movements.
- **Financial Analysts**: Analyze market trends and provide actionable insights.

By accurately forecasting stock prices, these stakeholders can better manage risks and optimize their portfolios.
